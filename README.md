ART Adherence Analysis

Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) adherence patterns. 
The goal is to explore factors affecting adherence among patients and to derive insights that can inform interventions to improve treatment outcomes.

Objectives:
1. To analyze patient data to identify trends and patterns in ART adherence.
2. To investigate demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors that impact adherence.
3. To provide actionable insights for healthcare stakeholders.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Preparing raw data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to identify adherence trends.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models to predict adherence levels.

Insights and Recommendations: Data-driven strategies to improve ART adherence.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Using anonymized patient data.

Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical data, etc.

EDA: Trends analysis and visualizations (e.g., adherence rates, demographic breakdown).

Modeling: Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, neural network and XGBoost.

Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results Interpretation: Visualizations and summaries.
